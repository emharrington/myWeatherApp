# My Weather App

This is my first proper project I've managed to create all on my own! It is a pretty basic weather app that allows the user to input a country or city & see what the weather's looking like right now. So, just like most weather apps.
I've used the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain the current weather data, which I found to be a lot easier to work with than expected :)

## How to run:

In your terminal paste the following:

`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode & automatically open [http://localhost:3000] so you can view it in your browser.
